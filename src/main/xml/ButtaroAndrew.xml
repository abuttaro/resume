							reduce boiler-plate code,
							easily and correctly support PATCH operations,
							design filter based services for decomposed code reuse,
							provide content negotiation for multiple JSON formats (JSON API/HAL),
							provide dynamic query capability,
							provide consistent parameter parsing,
							support sparse fields, compound documents
							and more.  
							Up! Test Framework
							offers API request builders for extremely concise and thorough testing. Source
							and a Spring Boot demo application are available on GitHub.

							dynamic filtering, pagination, and sorting. Swagger doc generated

						<!-- 
						Andy Buttaro
 has been always a champion of code standards, quality & building code as per the requirements. 
 To achieve this, he always starts by deeply understanding the business requirements
 , challenging any design that increases technical debt in our system. 
 His next biggest contribution is writing unit tests before any coding begins. 
 So far, for the very complex Scheduling backend & APIs, he has written close to 800 tests
. The tests have greatly help reduce potential defects on the complex backend. 
 Andy has also been working with QA teams to support automation efforts and Release Engineering 
 to support streamlining the unit test execution before each build.
